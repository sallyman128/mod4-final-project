# Description
This application renders a single page application on a web browser and fetches data from a backend rails API. The user is able to create a note with a title and body and post it to be viewed at the bottom of the page. The user can then add tags to any already posted note to better categorize or identify it. The user may also choose delete either tags or notes.

# Install Instructions
In your terminal and in the backend directory, run "$ bundle install" to download and install all the supporting gems. Then, while still in the backend directory, run "$ rails server". Then, feel free to open the index.html file on Google Chrome and begin using the app.
